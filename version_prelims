Version 0.1.1 -- preliminary

* Fixed `hash_df$print()` to only show 20 columns and display correctly for small data sets

* Removed `as_Iterator()`

* Changes `is_Iterator()` to use `inherits()` instead of `class() ==`

* Fixed bug in `we_have()` that wrote over an old set-created `Iterator` when a new one was made, even with a different name
